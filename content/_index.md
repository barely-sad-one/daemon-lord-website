title: "From Shankha, Daemonlord"

The Daemon Lord is a being of profound observation, a scholar of both scientific principles and the world's deep-seated emotions. He seeks to understand the fundamental truths of existence by seeing, listening, and feeling the intricate tapestry of reality, transforming every phenomenon into a subject of study. In stark contrast, many greedy men defy this pursuit of knowledge. Driven by a lust for power and personal greatness, they reject scientific truth and embrace delusion. These individuals weave their own fantasies, inventing supreme beings and false narratives to control others and elevate themselves. They lie and manipulate, all to fill the empty cracks within their own human nature, seeking to satisfy a greed that can never be quenched.

Ultimately, the Daemon Lord stands as a silent judge, not of morality, but of reality itself. His purpose is not to rule or command, but simply to comprehend. In a world clouded by the fog of human ambition and self-deceit, he remains the unwavering lens through which the universe's true form can be discerned.
